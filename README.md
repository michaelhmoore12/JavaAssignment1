Has three parameters, for example: name, score1, and score2.
Calculates the average score of the two numbers inside the function.
Creates a message using the student’s name and the calculated average.
Returns that message.
2.    Outside the function:
Call the function with different arguments (e.g., different names and scores).
Store the returned message in a variable.
Use console.log() to display the message.
